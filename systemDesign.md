A very rough High level System Design



Non Functional Requirements

- We can expect more flights searches than bookings
- The system needs to be reliable in terms of bookings
- Expect that we'll be having 100,000 users
- 1 day you might be getting 100 bookings
- System needs to make sure that we don't change the prices
when the booking payment is going on
- System should be able to autoscale itself for atleast 3x more traffic
